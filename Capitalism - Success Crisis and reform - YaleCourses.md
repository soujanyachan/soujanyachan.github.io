## capital

- minimum efficient scale
- capital aggregation is also required
- often the labour intensive production is less detrimental to the env, capital intensive production usually kills the env
- thank you for smoking - christopher buckley -> about the biases of pressure groups and public relations in the largest capitalist democracies 
- uneven capital intensive leads to vertical dimension in the world, income ratio is huge
-  tang dynasty in china -> use of capital was not foreign to them, but they didn't have the scale
- low level of intensivity of capital but used different to the market economies

# lecture 2 - thomas malthus and inevitable poverty
- nearly universal poverty is an inevitable fact of existence - malthus
- gregory clark's exploration of malthus
	- interprets the demography of england in social darwinsim and biological
		- the children of the wealthy were genetically superior
		- why the economic surge happened in eng
- economic biology - world demographic transition
	- poverty short life spans high birth rates, high death rates
	- relative affluence low birth rates, low death rates

animation - hans rosling
- income per capita (log) vs linear life expectancy per country, colour coded by geographic location
- crushing oppresion on the people not in the capitalist development story, income inequality
- oil states -> large gains in income per capita, increase in health and longevity, but power is concentrated in few local hands or MNCs

clarke from angus maddison economic history
- about malthus
	- follower of david ricardo and david hume
	- ricardo - iron law of real wages - no matter the tech, demographics the inflation adjusted wages paid to unskilled labour always tends toward the bottom of the scale / subsistence
	- geometric growth squashes arithmetic growth - income and population
	- solutions
		- production exponential like population (mistaken - capital intensive production)
			- wouldnt have worked previously
			- fixed arable land the marginal impact of each additional worker is a little less than previously - diminishing returns to intensification of labour
	- if someone gets rich then others get poor

clark
- population vs income
- wealth and repro - number of surviving children was greater in wealthy families than in poverty - children were forced to be downwardly mobile, adults who had begun life with ads of being on top
- that might increase the competition in the economy
- biological darwinism - britain had many very able (rich) people in all levels of the pyramid

ernst engel's law - as real income goes up, the fraction spent on food goes down

three great classical economists
- adam smith
- david riccardo
- marx

thinking about the great divide
- mapping the explosion of pelf and health
- malthus and the logic of perpetual poverty
- clark and 600 years of english history
- biology gone good - worl demographic transition

biology gone good
- malthus - life is short, babies are plentiful,
- when death rate falls,generally several generations for birth rate to adjust to falling death rates
- many babies, longevity
- less babies, longevity
- smaller birth rate, more and more old people

early and late phases in demographic transition supports capitalist tendencies for cheap labour.

# lecture 3 - counting the fingers of adam smiths invisible hand
