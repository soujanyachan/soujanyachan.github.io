 A bit of a genre mix-up here but...

&#x200B;

Ok, one of these stories involves a deliberate lie, but a lot of truth besides; Maria Vale's Wolf Series. (This is also one of the most beautiful werewolf series I have ever read. The only thing I wondered about was, what would happen if these characters met Native American wolf legends? But on its own the trilogy is just... astonishingly heartbreaking.)

Maggie Stiefvater's Scorpio Races - young adult story but oh, my goodness, it's something else. The characters don't miscommunicate. They communicate perfectly, that doesn't mean it's easy.

&#x200B;

Bring on the Blessings, Beverly Jenkins. A bit more faithful than my usual read, but her writing is glorious and there's things that she looks at with clear, unflinching eyes that are real tough if you're expecting a standard romance.

&#x200B;

Cat Sebastian's stuff can be a bit anachronistic to me, but her romances definitely  include some excellent communication between the characters.

&#x200B;

T. Kingfisher's stuff tends to be hella practical and completely not interested in manufactured drama.She is one of my absolute favorite authors. Fair warning, there's only romance in some of them; ex, "The twisted Ones" has zero romance and lots of horror so... yeah, consume her stuff with caution. Try her Clocktauer war and Swordheart books for romance.

&#x200B;

Andrea K. Host's stuff is universally wonderful. I just sit in awe of her. Another pragmatic writer who still manages to instill her writing with high drama and romantic tension.

&#x200B;

Megan Whalen Turner, The Queen's Thief series.

&#x200B;

Tammy Faulkner's Reed Brothers stuff (I lost interest after, like, 7 books, but the first ones were Hella Awesome)

&#x200B;

Date Night On Union Station was a fun book; light romance, heavy on slice of life with gently amusing notes about life in a sci-fi sort of world.

&#x200B;

M. C. A. Hogarth tends to be awesome, if dark at times.

&#x200B;

Courtney Milan, Ms. Martin's Incomparable Adventure - older lesbians, so non-standard, but a lovely romance story. Her other romances are good too but her writing has absolutely evolved over the years as she moved from standard historical stuff on to finding her voice; she's one of those writers who's gotten better with time instead of getting stale.

&#x200B;

Ok, some boys:

Tade Thompson's Rosewater has a teensy bit of a romance going on in there whose only communication issues are far more to do with practical real-world reasons not to talk than angst, and he is a damn fine read anyways so if you haven't, then pick up his books.

&#x200B;

Frank Tuttle's Markhat Files have a lovely relationship in them where they are genuine partners, but the love really shines. I always recommend his stuff because he's one of the most amazing writers that nobody else seems to have read and I cannot stand for someone this good to not get all the readers.

&#x200B;

Unread at this time:

&#x200B;

On my list to be read are "The Kiss Quotient" and "Rafe: A Buff Male Nanny".
