 Humans share an empathic bond with a smallish but built like a tank rhino-elephant-with-psychic-tendrils alien species . Cute in a bizarre way. They provide their humans with superior emotional stability in trade for cushy lives compared to their wild cousins. Some group is politically against the bonded humans. They release a virus to kill the aliens. Losing the bond, in and out, drives the humans mad. Oops. These are high ranking humans, after all. 

Something something scientist to investigate has to team up with the boy she dated back when they thought they would both bond, but didn't. So he became a hybrid hacker. She bonded. This whole planet, and her sanity, are about to go down the shitter unless she finds the cure and he finds the culprit.
