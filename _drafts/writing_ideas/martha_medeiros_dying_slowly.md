 [POEM] You start dying slowly by Martha Medeiros
 
 “You start dying slowly
 if you do not travel,
 if you do not read,
 If you do not listen to the sounds of life,
 If you do not appreciate yourself.
 
 You start dying slowly
 When you kill your self-esteem;
 When you do not let others help you.
 
 You start dying slowly
 If you become a slave of your habits,
 Walking everyday on the same paths…
 If you do not change your routine,
 If you do not wear different colours
 Or you do not speak to those you don’t know.
 
 You start dying slowly
 If you avoid to feel passion
 And their turbulent emotions;
 Those which make your eyes glisten
 And your heart beat fast.
 
 You start dying slowly
 If you do not change your life when you are not satisfied with your job, or with your love,
 If you do not risk what is safe for the uncertain,
 If you do not go after a dream,
 If you do not allow yourself,
 At least once in your lifetime,
 To run away from sensible advice.”
