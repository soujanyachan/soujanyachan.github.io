constant and variable capital
constant is past labour already present in the raw material and means of prod

scissors depreciates in value and shirt gets more value, decreases everytime it is used

variable is current labour hiring of labour power

total value is constant plus variable plus surplus

capitalist must avoid the workers from realising that they create the surplus value
