Debt funds are considered to be less risky as compared to equity funds. If you are investing with a short time horizon, where capital protection is your major objective, debt funds may be an ideal option. However, this is not to say that debt funds are free from risks. Debt funds carry the following risks, based on the fixed income instruments that they are investing in: Interest rate risk: Debt funds invest in fixed income securities that are interest bearing. Prices of these funds fall when interest rates rise and vice versa. Credit risk: Some debt funds invest in securities that carrying a low credit rating. This means that there is a risk of not receiving regular payments from their underlying securities. Default risk: Though these instances are rare, some funds can face a default risk when the issuer of the bond fails to make the stipulated payment.
