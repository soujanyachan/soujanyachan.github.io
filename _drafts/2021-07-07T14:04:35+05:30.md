[[feminism]]
So many men (and unfortunately in my own experiences it was just men) who didn’t like when my boundaries interrupted their shittiness, or “inconvenienced” them. But they could have regular boundaries and enforce them and that was okay. I still have so much residual anger towards myself for allowing these assholes to walk all over me.
