An angry man doesn’t care who is right or wrong, only that he’s been slighted,

the future, the moment a person begins raising their voice, speaking over you, or treating you in an unprofessional way, I would give them one chance to correct themselves, letting them know in a professional tone, “If you continue to (raise your voice/speak over me/etc) I will have to let you go as we cannot continue this conversation in a productive and respectful way. Can you allow me to explain your options?” 

If you try to again communicate and it’s unproductive and unprofessional, “It seems we are not able to communicate effectively at this time, have a good day.” And then follow up by email only. Also email your boss and HR about the information. No speculation, just facts. If the rude person does not have an email, pass along their number to your boss and again, just explain factually that they were doing X,Y,Z, making you uncomfortable, and passing the ball to the superior to handle as they
see fit.
