do a lot of L2 application support work which requires me to ask questions to multiple app dev partners (L3 support resources) and business analyst (who have deep product knowledge). 

I'm a believer of the what, when, why, who and how methodology of asking questions. Here is the escalation ladder and some of my recommendations:

 1. Frame what the problem is and ensure you have a good enough understanding of the issue that you can explain it to a non-technical person. As a person who used to struggle with speaking anxiety, a helpful methodology for me is to write down what I'm going to say on a notepad window.

 2. Have a good scope of where the problem is. Search/Read the documentation or any knowledge repository that your team might have. People expect a level of competency and self searching before escalating. 

 3. Think about when to start asking questions. If it's taking you more than 15-20 mins to search documentation or you are in a bind of time, it's time to start asking questions. Also know when it's a good time to ask questions and this varies from team to team. Should you ask questions in the middle of the the discussion at the meeting or at the end? Is it towards the end of the day and should you be asking a complicated question at 5:30 PM on Friday when everyone is ready to get off work for the weekend?

 4. Have an escalation ladder of who you should be asking the questions. Usually for me, I ask a question to a peer, senior peer, app dev partner, and etc. Is there a rotation of senior app dev folks you should talk to?

 5. Think about why you are reaching out to this person. Is this person's functionality on the team in the scope of your question? 

 6. How are you going to reach out to this person? What is the most effective way to communicate the issue and the senior app dev person to provide the solution? Will it be through email, chat, or call with screenshare? In the rare likeliness of an intern dealing with a production issue, is there a paging system vs. making a phone call?

Finally, I want to say that you're an intern and they expect you to ask questions. It's better to ask questions early on vs. pretending you know what you are doing and failing forward.

I hope this helps!
