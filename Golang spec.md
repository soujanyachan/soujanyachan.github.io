Go is a general-purpose language designed with systems programming in mind. It is 
- strongly typed 
- garbage-collected 
- has explicit support for concurrent programming

Programs are constructed from _packages_, whose properties allow efficient management of dependencies.

The grammar is compact and simple to parse, allowing for easy analysis by automatic tools such as integrated development environments.
